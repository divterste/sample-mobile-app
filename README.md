# How I solved the assignment 

1. Used Fork to create a new repository
2. Created new GitHub Workflow (actions)
3. Created seperate "jobs" for Android & iOS and named them Google and Apple respectively
5. Continous integration that builds & produces for both Android & iOS

# sample-mobile-app
This is a sample mobile app built with react native

## How to run

Here are the prerequisites for this app:
- node
- npm
- yarn
- expo and expo-cli


Once you have installed the above:
```shell
yarn install # To install app dependencies
yarn start # To start the app locally, you can open iOS, Android, or web from here.
```
